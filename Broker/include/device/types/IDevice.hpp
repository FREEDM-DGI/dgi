/// The IDevice class provides the public interface used by devices.  It has an
/// associated set of device signals, defined by derived classes, which can be
/// accessed through the public IDevice::Get and IDevice::Set functions.
///
/// @limitations Devices may be invalidated at any time as they enter or leave
///              the system.  Currently there is no way of determining whether
///              a device is valid or not.  It would be easy to add this
///              functionality, but have instead decided to spare clients the
///              pain of checking for this by making the assumption that
///              clients will retain references to devices for only a short
///              period of time, and that it is not a significant error if
///              operations performed on these devices fail.  (We may revise
///              this decision in the future if need be.)  Therefore, you
///              should never store a reference to an IDevice (or a child
///              instance) for long.  Your module should regularly renew its
///              understanding of the devices in the system with the device
///              manager.  Gets on an invalid device always return the last
///              valid value; Sets silently fail.
