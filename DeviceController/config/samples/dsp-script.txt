# valid commands are:
#
# enable devicetype devicename signal1 initialVal1 signal2 initialVal2 ...
# disable devicename
# change devicename signal newvalue
# work n
# sleep n
# dieHorribly
# sendtofactory filename
# sendtoadapter filename
#
# Whenever you enable or disable a device, the controller will send a quit
# request to DGI, and will reinitiate connection with the new device attached
# once that succeeds. So each enable/disable will take several seconds.
# 
# dieHorribly is simply a scripted crash.
#
# work is used to pass time without enabling/disabling devices or dying.
# i.e. it is used for normal operation of the controller. For implementation
# simplicity, n refers to the number of rounds of sends/receives to execute
# successfully, where one round is one send and one receive. So the seconds
# of work is lower bounded by n*(stateTimeout+commandTimeout), where
# stateTimeout is set by the controller and commandTimeout by DGI. (Never
# mind that the controller is mostly going to be blocking during this work.)
# You can also 'work forever' if it's the last command in the script.
#
# Use sendtofactory and sendtoadapter to specify the name of a file containing a
# packet to send to the DGI. Envisioned useful for testing error cases. When
# sending to the factory, open a socket connection to the factory, send the
# packet, then print the factory's response and disconnect. When sending to the
# adapter, just send the packet and print the factory's response. (sendtoadapter
# cannot be the first command in the script.) BadRequests will be logged.

# *The parser accepts comments only if they start on the first column!*

# Note that this won't work, it's just to show the syntax for devices with
# multiple signals. If we did add weirdsetting to SST, each SST would need
# to specify the initial value here. Zeroes cannot be assumed!
